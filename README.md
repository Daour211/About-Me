### About-Me

I build a web page to intrdouce myself and set a questions to user, so he/she can test how much she/he knows about me. And for each question answered, he/she will know if he/she got it right or wrong.

### Reflections & Comments: 

 - This begining of building this project is all good.
 - I have a question about the **let** and how can I use its value in such long projects.
 - It took me 2 hours to finish it. I expected this much of time beacuse of the styling part.
